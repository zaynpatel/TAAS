#  MTH3199: Theory and Application of Algebraic Structures

Code repository for MTH3199: Special Topics in Mathematics: Theory and Application of Algebraic Structures. This course is taught by Professor Sarah Spence Adams (Olin College of Engineering). 

MTH3199 is a self-directed math course in which students choose topics in Linear and Abstract Algebra to explore further and build projects to demonstrate their understanding of technical material. Given my interest in data science and machine learning, I chose several "capstone"-like topics (Least Squares Approximation, Singular Value Decomposition, Matrix Calculus) from these fields and prepared technical presentations along with Jupyter Notebooks to share my understanding with the class and the public.

My first deliverable: [Least Squares Approximation from Scratch](https://github.com/zaynpatel/TAAS/tree/main/Deliverable_1)

My second deliverable: [Latent Semantic Analysis: Low Rank Approximation of the TF-IDF Matrix](https://github.com/zaynpatel/LTA2061/blob/main/PracticeLSA2.ipynb)

My third deliverable: [Introduction to Matrix Calculus](https://github.com/zaynpatel/TAAS/tree/main/Deliverable_3)

**Note: If you are interested in my second deliverable please also visit [calculate.ipynb](https://github.com/zaynpatel/LTA2061/blob/main/FinalProject/calculate.ipynb) for the most accurate explanation and code to build the TF-IDF matrix from scratch. Use this explanation to replace the TF-IDF section in the original notebook.**
